`This paper focused on the extractive question answering on the SQUAD dataset, presenting a novel neural architecture called RASOR .The core of this model relies on a recurrent network that enables shared computation for the shared substructure across span candidates. They explored different methods of encoding the passage and question, showing the benefits of including both passage-independent and passage-aligned question representations.`
